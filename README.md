# Solid Studio

A Smart contract management system that makes easy the interaction, exploration and visualisation of smart contracts deployed to different networks.

- Minimalistic
- Simple
- Elegant
- High Performance

## Motivation

Let's be honest, accessing the Blockchain is difficult, you need to install geth, find your credentials, attach to an rpc endpoint and then start typing web3 commands. This process repeats over and over again, also the problem is that your scripts won't be there the next time you try to attach again, we call this: `geth pain`;

Additionaly, if you want to execute smart contract functions or check the storage of a contract? Can you make it with existing tools? Probably not, but we can do it better and that is why we are creating Solid.

The next generation of smart contract tools to make the exploration and inspection of smart contracts a seamless experience.

Discover the hidden world of smart contracts with Solid.
